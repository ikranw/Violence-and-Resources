# Violence-and-Resources
Data Visualization Course, Project 1. Project 1 is about creating an interactive visualization application to help a general audience explore data about countries in the world. 
I decided to create an interactive vsiaulziation on countries' data with violence and resources to see if there are any correlations between the two. My hypothesis is that the lesser the amount of resources, the higher rate of violence will be. I think violence and crime, like theft, is a last resort typically of those who have no other options.
